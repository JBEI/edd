# Experiment Data Depot

The Experiment Data Depot (EDD) is an online tool designed as a repository of standardized
biological experimental data and metadata. The EDD can easily uptake experimental data, provide
visualization of these data, and produce downloadable data in several standard output formats. See
the deployed version at [public-edd.jbei.org][1]. An academic article describing the EDD is
available at ACS Synthetic Biology: Morrell, et al "The Experiment Data Depot: A Web-Based
Software Tool for Biological Experimental Data Storage, Sharing, and Visualization". Get
[the article][18] from the ACS website.

The EDD is available under a [BSD 3-Clause License][6] and is actively developed at the
[Lawrence Berkeley National Lab][7] (LBL) by the [Joint BioEnergy Institute][8] (JBEI), supported
by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental
Research, through contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 between LBL and DOE.

The source code of EDD is published on [GitHub][9]. Pull requests should adhere to the
[Contributing Guidelines][10], and bug reports or feature requests should be directed to the
GitHub project.

## Getting Started <a name="#Getting_Started"/>

The EDD is packaged as a collection of [Docker][2] container images. With the [Docker Compose][3]
tool, all the components of EDD are configured to work together, and requires no other installation
of dependencies. Docker has installers available for several operating systems [here][15]. The
Docker for Mac installer includes both Docker and Docker Compose; the installers for Linux
environments currently only include Docker, and Docker Compose must be [installed separately][16].
EDD does not test with, or support, Docker for Windows at this time. Docker versions should be
v.18.09 or greater. Docker Compose should be v.1.24 or greater.

With [Docker][2] and [Docker Compose][3] installed, launching the entire EDD
software stack is as simple as cloning the repository and running the following
commands from a terminal in that directory:

    ./bin/init-config offline --deploy=dev
    docker-compose up -d

The first time EDD runs, it must complete some setup tasks before the UI is
available. You may monitor progress with `docker-compose logs -f http` and wait
for `Starting production appserver` to appear (you can quit viewing logs with
Ctrl+c), or simply wait a few minutes. You can then access the EDD through a
browser with [http://edd.lvh.me][13], a domain that maps all requests to the
localhost IPv4 address of `127.0.0.1`. Using this domain allows for your
browser to be directed to the correct service, and looks nicer than an
IP address.

Without additional configuration, the launched copy of EDD will be using
default options. It will only be available on your local computer, and some
functions (e.g. TLS support, external authentication) will not work. See
[Deployment][5] for more detailed instructions for installing Docker and
configuring EDD for your deployment environment.

Create an account by registering with a valid email. Creating an account
without configuring EDD may send an email which gets caught by spam filters. Be
sure to check there if the confirmation message does not appear within a few
minutes. Once the email is confirmed, the user name for logging in is the
registered email address.

You may test the edd installation by following the [Public EDD tutorials][14].
The part ID numbers in the example files point to the Public Registry, and must
be removed from the example files in order to complete the tutorial.

For a more detailed reference for EDD's low-level configuration options, see [Configuration][4].
Instructions on administering an EDD instance can be found in the [Administration][11] document,
and steps to deploy a new instance are in the [Deployment][5] document. Getting a development
environment set up to modify or contribute to EDD is outlined in the [Developer Setup][12]
document. The [Troubleshooting][17] guide details some commands to diagnose problems.
