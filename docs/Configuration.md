# Configuring EDD

This page gives an overview of the most useful configuration options built into EDD. There are
several sources of configuration available and some are described in further detail in sections
below. Broadly speaking, each of the Docker containers used by EDD has its own configuration(s),
as well as several configuration files for Docker itself. See comments within each file for a
detailed description of some of the options.

* __Docker configuration files__
  These files configure EDD's docker containers and enable you to launch EDD and most of its
  dependencies with a single command.
    * `secrets`: Directory stores passwords and URL's for the various services EDD has to connect
      to, and makes them accessible to EDD's Docker containers. Make sure to control access to
      this directory! It is meant to contain secrets for external services, and should be
      protected as any other password file. The `.gitignore` should exclude this directory.
    * `docker-compose.yml`: Configures EDD's docker containers as run by Docker Compose. This is
      set up in a working configuration with basic default settings, but you may wish to change
      container definitions, etc. based on your computing needs, available resources, and
      deployment strategy. See the [Docker-compose documentation][1] for reference. Most local
      changes should go in the `docker-compose.override.yml` file. The override file is not
      included in the repository, but can be automatically generated from an example template file
      `docker-compose.yml-example`. See comments in the example file, and the related
      [Docker-compose extends documentation][2] for reference.

* __EDD Django configuration files__: Much of EDD's functionality runs through the Django
  framework, and can be configured using Django's settings mechanism. See "EDD Django
  Configuration Files" below for more details.

* __Service-specific scripts and configuration__: The full definitions of services and
  configurations used in EDD are contained in the `docker` directory. Each service can be
  configured per the documentation provided by the maintainer of the used image, or a different
  image can be used. Links to the documentation for EDD service images are provided here
  for reference:
    * [postgres][9]
    * [redis][10]
    * [solr][11]
    * [rabbitmq][12]
    * [nginx][13]


## EDD Django Configuration Files

As a Django application, EDD loads its configuration with Python code. The settings of EDD are
designed to load in default values, while allowing for overrides with a `local.py` settings file.
An example of this file can be found at `edd/settings/local.py-example`. Custom settings are
loaded with a `volume` definition and the `--local PATH` option to the `command` in each of the
`edd` and `worker` services. An example of how to load a custom `local.py` file is
included in the `docker-compose.override.yml-example` file (search for the text `[LOCAL]`).

Most of the available configuration parameters are defined by Django in its [documentation][3], or
by Celery in its [configuration documentation][4]. The settings for non-core Django applications
used by EDD can be found with each individual project:
* [django_extensions][14]
* [rest_framework][15]
* [form_utils][16]
* [messages_extends][17]
* [django-allauth][5]

The defaults used by EDD are defined in the following files found under `edd/settings`:
* `base.py`: defines baseline default settings that make EDD work out-of-the box.
* `celery.py`: Defines EDD's Celery-specific configuration.
* `auth.py`: Defines authentication-specific settings.

Settings unique to EDD will generally be prefixed with `EDD_`. Commentary for each of these,
including possible values, should be included in the `local.py-example` file.


### Configuring Social Logins <a name="Social"/>

* For broad overview, refer to the [django-allauth documentation][5].
* To use a new provider:
    * Add the provider application to `INSTALLED_APPS`
    * Put logos in `./main/static/main/images/` and update styles in `./main/static/main/login.css`
* From the admin site, add a new Social application, using Client ID and Secret Key from provider
    * [Github registration][6]
    * [Google registration][7]
    * [LinkedIn registration][8]
* Each provider may require additional details about the application, allowed domains and/or
  URLs, etc.


### Using an External Postgres Server

You may want to use an external postgres server instead of the Postgres Docker container configured
in EDD's default `docker-compose.yml`. If so, you'll want to follow this general outline:

* Manually run similar commands to those in `bin/postgres/000_init.sql`, to create
  databases and roles for user and celery data.
* Update secrets directory with the correct database URLs for both edd and celery databases.
* (optional) Remove the service definition for `postgres` in `docker-compose.yml` file.
