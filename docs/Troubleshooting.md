# Troubleshooting

Like any complex system, the EDD will sometimes fail to behave as expected. The
steps listed in this document can help narrow down where a fault is occurring,
and assist in fixing any problems.

-   **Check container status**
    Run `docker ps -a` to get a listing of every container and its current
    state. If the `STATUS` column in this output has `(unhealthy)` listed after
    the uptime, that container should be investigated to find why healthchecks
    are failing. More information can be found by running
    `docker inspect {CONTAINER-ID}` and/or `docker logs {CONTAINER-ID}`.

-   **Force removing containers**
    Some containers may not properly exit and clean up after themselves. These
    containers will show with an `Exited` status. These can be removed with
    `docker rm {CONTAINER-ID}`. To remove _all_ containers, run:

        docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm

-   **Force removing volumes**
    Docker Volumes containing stale data can sometimes cause problems launching
    containers. You can see a listing of all Volumes with `docker volume ls`.
    The list can be limited to Volumes not currently attached to a container
    with `docker volume ls -f 'dangling=true'`. Anonymous Volumes will have a
    64-character hexdecimal hash as a name; EDD will generate several Volumes
    with names like `{PROJECT}_{SERVICE}data`, `eddmedia_{TIMESTAMP}`, or
    `eddstatic_{TIMESTAMP}`.

    Volumes can be removed with `docker volume rm {VOLUME-NAME}`. _This will
    delete ALL data saved to the Volume and remove it!_ Use the script
    `${BASE}/bin/backup_volume.sh` if you want to recover any of this data. If
    the Redis service in the `edd` project is having problems, you could try
    stopping EDD, then running `docker volume rm edd_redisdata` before
    restarting EDD. To remove _all_ volumes, run

        docker volume ls -q | xargs docker volume rm

-   **Pull or Build updated images**
    See the currently installed Docker Images with `docker image ls`. Run
    `docker-compose pull` to check Docker Hub for updated versions of images.
    Clean up older/unused images with `docker image rm {IMAGE-ID}` and remove
    all unused images with:

        docker images -qf 'dangling=true' | xargs docker rmi

-   **View logs**
    Check the log output for containers with `docker logs {CONTAINER-ID}` or
    `docker-compose logs {SERVICE-NAME}`.
