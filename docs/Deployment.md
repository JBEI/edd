# Deploying EDD

## Pre-requisites

Have [Docker][1] and [Docker Compose][2] installed on the target host. EDD is tested with Docker
version 18.09.2 and Docker Compose version 1.23.2; these instructions are not guaranteed to
work for any older versions of Docker or Docker Compose. Also have at least the `bin` and `docker`
directories, along with `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml-example` copied to
the target host.

## Initial configuration

There are many configuration options that can be set before launching EDD. The `init-config`
script handles creating additional options based on included example files:

-   **`secrets`**: Directory contains secret values loaded into containers at launch; these
    values will generally be passwords, keys, and other secret information.
-   **`docker-compose.override.yml`**: Overrides the default configuration used to launch the
    Docker containers. Non-secret environment, and other launch options will be put into this file.

More information and example configuration options can be found in the example files, and copied
into the files created automatically by the `init-config` script.

## Starting EDD

Before starting a deployment, the Docker images used by the various EDD services must be present
on the host computer. This is accomplished either by pulling already-built images from a Docker
Registry, or building the images from the Dockerfiles included in the project. To pull the images,
use `docker-compose pull`. Customizing builds is beyond the scope of this document, consult the
individual README files included with each Dockerfile if a custom build is required.

## TLS and domain configuration

EDD includes a set of Docker containers to auto-configure an [Nginx][3] webserver with TLS
encryption via certificates generated with the [Let's Encrypt][4] service. By setting some
environment in the `http` service container, EDD will generate a configuration file for Nginx to
proxy HTTP requests and secure connections with TLS.

To proxy requests to a container, set the environment variables `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `VIRTUAL_PORT`
on that container. The values of these variables are the DNS hostname, and the port exposed on the
container, respectively. These values are set automatically for the central EDD service by the
`init-config` script, but only for a single domain, via the `--domain` option. For more advanced
configuration, consult the documentation for the [`letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-compainion`][6].

If alternate TLS configuration -- or any other Nginx configuration -- is desired, replace the
default `nginx` service image with one containing options for your alternate configuration, or
re-write the `nginx.tmpl` template.

## Linking to an ICE server

The purpose of EDD is to store actionable datasets in synthetic biology engineering. An important
piece of information in understanding this data is the genetic sequences of engineered organisms.
The EDD uses another piece of JBEI software, the [Inventory of Composable Elements][7], or ICE, to
keep track of this information. Any functionality on EDD that deals with linking to strains will
not work unless the EDD server is connected to an ICE server.

To link to an ICE server, EDD uses a Base64-encoded key. Create a key using a command like this:

    openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n' > hmac.key

This will create a file named `hmac.key`. Copy this file to the `secrets` directory, and add a
secret to the `docker-compose.override.yml` configuration for the services using `edd-core` and
`ice`. The `edd-core` image will check for a secret named `edd_ice_key`, and the `ice` image will
load in HMAC keys using the value of the `ICE_HMAC_SECRETS` environment.

## Creating an EDD administrator account

Several parts of EDD's configuration is contained within the running application's database,
instead of loaded from files at startup. A login account to the EDD application, with access to
the administration interface, is the easiest way to edit this configuration. To create an
administrator account, run this command inside the `http` service, after EDD has
finished startup:

    python manage.py createsuperuser

The command will prompt for a username, email address, and password. Logging in with the username
and password combination will send a confirmation email to the provided address. Once the email
is validated, the account is active and an "Administration" link to the EDD will appear on every
page, which will load the administration interface when clicked.

## Customizing EDD

Inside the administration interface, a few items should be modified prior to serious use of the
application.

1. Set the site name and domain in **Sites**. The default confirmation email will use `example.com`
   as the name of the EDD site, because that is the default value set in the Sites admin. Click
   through to **Sites**, and then through to **example.com** to edit the name and domain to match
   your deployment.
2. Set **Brandings** to use. This admin section sets the logo, favicon, and custom stylesheets
   used in EDD. Click through to **Add Branding** to upload these custom files and associate them
   with the default site set in the previous step.
3. Create **Flat pages**. These are simple text pages to display in EDD. Here is where you can
   add pages containing information like Privacy Policies, Terms of Service, etc.
4. Add **Social applications**. This section is where you can configure logins using OAuth from
   other services, such as Google, LinkedIn, etc. This will also require changes to `local.py` to
   add the Django apps for each login provider. See the [django-allauth documentation][5] for more
   details.

## Custom Python configuration <a name="#Python_Config"/>

The following configuration options are specific to EDD and may be overridden in a `local.py`.

-   `EDD_ALLOW_SIGNUP` -- boolean flag; if True, self-registration of accounts is enabled.
-   `EDD_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` -- string value, changes background color and adds a visual
    environment label to assist in telling apart testing vs production instances. A None value
    will result in no visual changes added to the interface.
-   `EDD_ENABLE_GRAPHQL` -- boolean flag; if True, publish a GraphQL endpoint for EDD.
-   `EDD_EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS` -- iterable of URL strings; these will be scripts added to the default
    EDD page template. Put links for any external scripts here, to avoid creating custom
    HTML templates.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_BULK_CREATE_BATCH_SIZE` -- integer value, default `None`; the maximum number of
    bulk object creations to perform in a batch for the prototype import tool. None results in all
    objects up to EDD_IMPORT_PAGE_SIZE being created in a single batch (i.e. in one query).
-   `EDD_IMPORT_BULK_PK_LOOKUP_BATCH` -- integer value, default 100; the maximum number of
    line or assay primary keys to include in a single bulk lookup query during the final execution
    of the prototype import. Affects import performance.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_ERR_REPORTING_LIMIT` -- integer value, default 25; the maximum number of
    occurrences of any single type of error reported to clients of the prototype import via
    websocket notifications. Error occurrences beyond this limit are not reported to clients.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_MTYPE_LOOKUP_ERR_LIMIT` -- integer value, default 25; the maximum number of
    measurement type identifier lookup errors to tolerate before aborting an import
    using the prototype import tool, or zero to look up all the types referenced in the file.
    Most measurement type identifiers are resolved by contacting third-party databases such as
    PubChem, so large numbers of lookups can be expensive. Keeping this number low makes the
    import more responsive, but raising it increases the amount of potentially useful user feedback
    generated by each import attempt.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_PAGE_SIZE` -- integer value, default 1,000; the maximum number of resolved
    import records stored in a single cache page prior to finally executing the import. Affects
    import performance for both legacy and the prototype import.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_PAGE_LIMIT` -- integer value; the maximum number of cache pages in a single import.
    Combined with `EDD_IMPORT_PAGE_SIZE`, this creates a limit on the number of values that can
    be imported and helps prevent erroneous or malicious imports from overwhelming the system.
    Affects import performance for both legacy and the prototype import.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_CACHE_LENGTH` -- integer value, default 24 hours; the expiration time in seconds
    after which an import is expired from the cache, regardless of whether it has been executed.
    Affects import performance for both legacy and the prototype import.
-   `EDD_IMPORT_REQUEST_FORMAT_SCRIPTS` -- a list of strings that contain JavaScript code to
    insert into the help page header for the prototype import. This setting exists to
    support integration with third-party apps. For example, some EDD deployments use this
    configuration to integrate with JIRA issue collectors, helping to automate user requests for
    additional data. Each string in the list should include the surrounding
    `<script></script>` tags. When a non-empty list is defined, the "request a protocol" button
    will be visible in the relevant help section, with id "request-format"
-   `EDD_IMPORT_REQUEST_MTYPE_SCRIPTS` -- a list of strings with JavaScript code to
    insert into the page header for the prototype import help. This setting
    supports integration with third-party apps. For example, some EDD deployments use this
    configuration to integrate with JIRA issue collectors, helping to automate user requests for
    additional configuration data. Each string in the list should include the surrounding
    `<script></script>` tags. When a non-empty list is defined, a "request a measurement
    type" button will be visible in the relevant help section, with id "request-mtype"
-   `EDD_IMPORT_REQUEST_PROTOCOL_SCRIPTS` -- a list of strings with JavaScript code to
    insert into the page header for the prototype import help. This setting
    supports integration with third-party apps. For example, some EDD deployments use this
    configuration to integrate with JIRA issue collectors, helping to automate user requests for
    additional configuration data. Each string in the list should include the surrounding
    `<script></script>` tags. When a non-empty list is defined, a "request a measurement
    type" button will be visible in the relevant help section, with id "request-protocol"
-   `EDD_IMPORT_REQUEST_UNITS_SCRIPTS` -- a list of strings with JavaScript code to
    insert into the page header for the prototype import help. This setting
    supports integration with third-party apps. For example, some EDD deployments use this
    configuration to integrate with JIRA issue collectors, helping to automate user requests for
    additional configuration data. Each string in the list should include the surrounding
    `<script></script>` tags. When a non-empty list is defined, a "request units" button will be
    visible in the relevant help section, with id "request-units"
-   `EDD_IMPORT_UPLOAD_LIMIT` -- integer value, default 1048576 = 1 MB; the maximum size in
    bytes of files accepted by the user interface for the prototype import tool. This value is
    also displayed to users in help text and error messages. The limit configured here is
    enforced by the import user interface, and is displayed to users in help text and in error
    messages if they attempt a larger upload. This setting does not affect the upload limit for
    the import REST API endpoint. In a typical installation, the REST API upload limit is
    configured and enforced separately by an nginx reverse proxy. The 1MB default value for
    EDD_IMPORT_UPLOAD_LIMIT is consistent with the nginx default value of `client_max_body_size`.
-   `EDD_LATEST_CACHE` -- string value; the name of the Django cache to use for storing a user's
    latest viewed studies.
-   `EDD_ONLY_SUPERUSER_CREATE` -- boolean flag, or the string "permission" (default False); if
    True, only superuser accounts may create new studies. If set to "permission", only users
    with the "Main | Study | Can Add Study" permission configured via the admin site may create
    new studies.
-   `ICE_KEY_ID` -- string value, the identifier of the shared key used to communicate with ICE.
-   `ICE_SECRET_HMAC_KEY` -- string value, base64-encoded key used to sign requests to ICE.
-   `ICE_URL` -- URL of the ICE instance associated with EDD.
-   `ICE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` -- 2-tuple of integers, for the seconds to set connection and read
    timeouts in communication with ICE.
-   `ICE_VERIFY_CERT` -- boolean flag; if True, use strict certificate verification when
    connecting to ICE. _Note_: older versions of EDD used the name `VERIFY_ICE_CERT` instead. EDD
    will check for this name and emit a warning; the old name will be removed at a future date.
-   `REQUIRE_UNIPROT_ACCESSION_IDS` -- boolean flag; if True, protein measurement IDs must conform
    to the pattern of UniProt identifiers. Otherwise, arbitrary text may label a protein.

### Configuring EDD's prototype import tool

EDD includes a prototype import tool being field tested as an eventual replacement for the
existing import tool. By default the prototype is turned off in production, but it may be useful
to enable it in some circumstances. The prototype will be phased into production use, so it's
possible that at points both tools may be useful until the transition is complete.

#### Enabling the prototype import tool

To enable the prototype, you have to configure it since it's disabled by default. To include the
new import app, add the following line to your `local.py`:

    EDD_USE_PROTOTYPE_IMPORT = True

#### Tuning prototype performance

To configure performance for the prototype import, see settings that start with `EDD_IMPORT`. Those that affect the prototype are marked as such, and be aware that a few impact both the
legacy and the prototype.

## Starting EDD

Once configured, EDD is launched with either `docker-compose` for a single-node deployment, or
`docker stack deploy` for a Swarm deployment:

    # For single-node deployment, launch in detached mode
    docker-compose up -d

    # For Swarm deployment:
    # 1. Make sure the swarm manager is set up
    docker swarm init
    # 2. Aggregate configuration files
    docker-compose config > stack.yml
    # 3. Launch the stack (replace [NAME] with desired stack name)
    docker stack deploy -c stack.yml [NAME]

To shut down EDD:

    # For single-node deployment
    docker-compose down

    # For Swarm deployment (replace [NAME] with deployed stack name)
    docker stack down [NAME]
