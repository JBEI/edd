### Mac OS Setup <a name="MacOS_Setup">¶</a>

This section contains directions for setting up a development environment for EDD on Mac OS.

#### XCode <a name="XCode">¶</a>

Macs have tools for development freely available, but these tools are not installed by default. To
ensure the necessary utilities are installed, get XCode from the App Store. After launching the
XCode app, you should be prompted to install additional components. As of OS X 10.9 "Mavericks"
or later, and macOS 10.12 "Sierra" or later, the utilites used by EDD can be installed by running
`xcode-select --install` from the Terminal.

##### Homebrew <a name="HomeBrew">¶</a>

[Homebrew][1] is a package manager for OS X. The Homebrew packages handle installation and
dependency management for Terminal software. The Caskroom extension to Homebrew does the same
for GUI applications. There is a `Brewfile` in the root of the EDD repository that defines the
software used for EDD development.

To install, run the below command in Terminal, and follow the prompts. NOTE: this command will
run automatically as part of the `start-edd.sh` script.

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

After installing Homebrew, the `brew` command will be available to run in Terminal. Running
`brew doctor` should say `Your system is ready to brew.` or describe any problems with the
install. From the edd root directory, `brew bundle` should install software defined in
the `Brewfile`.

It is a good idea to occaisionally run `brew update` to refresh Homebrew's list of available
packages and versions; and run `brew upgrade` to install updated versions of your installed
Homebrew packages.

#### Docker <a name="Docker">¶</a>

[Docker][2] is a container virtualization platform: all software, configuration, and
dependencies required to run a service are packaged into standalone images. These images are
ready to run immediately upon being copied to a new host running a Docker daemon. Docker is
installed with the `Brewfile` in the previous section.

Verify that Docker is installed and setup correctly by running: `docker run --rm hello-world`.
If you get `docker: command not found`, that means Docker was not successfully installed from
Homebrew. Try getting the Docker for Mac installer directly from the Docker project. The related
`docker-compose` utility manages launching multiple services in multiple containers, based on a
configuration file. Running the `docker-compose` command should display some help text describing
the options for using the tool. If you do not see this help, try re-installing Docker for Mac.

Resources available for Docker containers are set in the Docker menu Preferences, under the
Advanced tab. It is recommended to allocate at least 2 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM to Docker. Click
the `Apply & Restart` button to restart Docker with updated resource allocations.

#### Next Steps

Complete [Common Setup Tasks](#Common) below to get an EDD development environment configured and
running for the first time. The "For Developers" section has a few additional recommendations to
ease development and debugging.


### Linux / Debian Setup <a name="Debian">¶</a>

This section contains directions for setting up a production deployment for EDD on Debian. Follow
the Docker-recommended instructions for [installing the daemon for your distro][5]. NOTE: there is
a `docker` package in the Debian apt repos. It is not [Docker][2]! There is a `docker.io` package
too; this can work, but the Debian-maintained packages will generally lag behind the official
Docker-maintained packages.

Test that Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running correctly by executing
`docker run --rm hello-world` and `docker-compose`, respectively. If all is well, proceed to
[Common Setup Tasks](#Common).


### Common Setup Tasks <a name="Common">¶</a>

After you have all of the Docker tools minimally configured for your environment, perform the
following steps to configure EDD and launch it for the first time.

1. __Clone the repo__: `git clone https://github.com/JBEI/edd.git`

2. __Install virtualenvwrapper__
    * `pip install virtualenvwrapper`
    * Create a folder for your virtualenvs; recommend `~/.virtualenvs` or `/usr/local/virtualenvs`
    * Add lines to your `.bashrc`:

          export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
          source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

    * Activate changes with `source ~/.bashrc`

3. __From `./docker_services/` run `. init-config --project edd`__

   This script will:
    * Test your git configuration
    * Copy sample configuration files
    * Generate random passwords for use in autoconfiguring EDD's Docker services
    * Create a virtualenv named `edd`

4. __Configure `secrets.env`__

   The `init-config` script will create a `secrets.env` file, containing generated passwords and
   connection URLs for services. These passwords are set in the service data volumes on first
   launch; to use alternate passwords or existing services (e.g. if you already have a Postgres
   cluster), edit the file prior to launching EDD.

5. (_optional_) __Build or Pull EDD's images__

   The start script will automatically ensure that Docker images are present on the host before
   launching; however, it is sometimes useful to run this step manually to have more control over
   the images used to launch containers.
    * Build images from the repository Dockerfiles with `docker-compose build`
    * Pull pre-built images from Docker Hub with `docker-compose pull`
    * Tag images with version tags using the `docker tag {src-image} {tag-name}` command

6. __Launch EDD's services__

   Run `./start-edd.sh`. At this point, you can use Docker commands to view the logs for
   each service or to locate the IP for viewing EDD's web interface.

   See "Running EDD" below for a list of helpful commands. If you skipped the previous step, this
   command will take significantly longer the first time you run it, since Docker has to initially
   build / configure the EDD services before they can run.

7. __Install and configure a supporting [ICE][7] deployment__

   EDD requires ICE as a reference for strains used in EDD's experiments. You will not be able to
   reference strains in your EDD studies until EDD can successfully communicate and authenticate
   with ICE.
    * Follow ICE's directions for installation/setup
    * Create a base-64 encoded HMAC key to for signing communication from EDD to ICE. EDD's default
      configuration assumes a key ID of 'edd', but you can change it by overriding the value of
      `ICE_KEY_ID` in your `local.py`. For example, to generate a random 64-byte/512-bit key:

          openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n' > hmac.key

    * Configure ICE with the HMAC key. In the `rest-auth` folder of the linked ICE deployment, copy
      the `hmac.key` file above to a file named with `ICE_KEY_ID`; 'edd' by default.
    * Configure EDD with the HMAC key. Edit `secrets.env` to set the value of `ICE_HMAC_KEY` to the
      value inside `hmac.key`. Do a `docker-compose restart` if you already had Docker running.
    * See directions under Common 'Maintenance/Development Tasks' to test EDD/ICE communication


### For Developers <a name="Developers">¶</a>

The EDD makes use of Node.js packages for managing front-end code. All dev dependencies are
contained in the root directory of a Docker image, available under the tag `jbei/edd-node` on
Docker Hub. This image has `node` and `npm` installed, with all the packages necessary to build
EDD. It is used as part of the build of the `jbei/edd-core` image, to prepare front-end assets.

EDD uses [TypeScript][4] for its client-side interface, and compiles JavaScript with third-party
libraries using [Webpack][9] during the build process for the `jbei/edd-core` image. Running a
full Docker build, for any change to the TypeScript code, will be inefficient. To avoid this,
follow these configuration steps to get changed TypeScript deployed to a running EDD automatically.

1. __Load local copy of EDD code__

   By default, EDD runs from code contained inside the Docker image. To run modified code, add an
   entry to the `services/edd/volumes` setting key in `docker-compose.override.yml` with the full
   path to code on your system. An example of this setting is commented out in the override file
   generated by `. init-config` from step 3 of [Common Setup Tasks](#Common).

2. __Add `--watch-static` to `command`__

   This flag to the EDD `entrypoint.sh` script will instruct EDD to watch for changes to static
   web assets, and copy changed files to the storage location for the webserver. Without this,
   the Django `python manage.py collectstatic` command would need to run manually. An example is
   in the `docker-compose.override.yml` under the comment tagged with `[DEVMODE]`.

3. __Launch EDD__

4. __Run the `jbei/edd-webpack` image__

   Run the below command to launch a container to watch for TypeScript changes and automatically
   compile them to new dist JavaScript files. Note, this image contains its own `tsconfig.json`
   and `webpack.config.js` files. If you are changing these files, e.g. to add a new module entry,
   you will need to build a new Docker image using the `Dockerfile.npm` file.

       docker run --rm \
           --volumes-from "$(docker-compose ps -q edd | head -1)" \
           jbei/edd-webpack

5. __Edit TypeScript files__

Some additional changes to aid in development can be made by changing the Django settings. Add
support for the [Django debug toolbar][10] in the sample `local.py` file to run EDD with
a helpful debug application. This will add an expandable toolbar to every page, showing
information like request headers, SQL queries run, template context, signals fired, etc.

## Running EDD <a name="#Running_EDD">¶</a>

This section is a quick reference for commonly helpful commands for running / developing EDD. Many
of them use Docker Compose and other related Docker tools that aren't fully documented here.

* __Docker services__

  `docker-compose` is the recommended tool for controlling EDD services. `docker-compose.yml`
  defines the list of services as top-level entries under the 'services' line.

  For quick reference, the provided services are:
    * __edd__: WSGI server that runs the EDD webapp
    * __websocket__: ASGI server that runs asynchronous parts of EDD
    * __worker__: long-running and background tasks are run here with Celery
    * __postgres__: provides EDD's database
    * __redis__: provides the cache back-end for EDD
    * __solr__: provides a search index for EDD
    * __rabbitmq__: messaging bus that supports Celery
    * __flower__: management / monitoring application for Celery
    * __smtp__: mail server that supports emails from EDD

  These additional services may be included as well:
    * __nginx__: webserver that proxies clients' HTTP requests to other Docker services
    * __nginx-gen__: monitors container start/stop events to generate configs for `nginx`
    * __letsencrypt__: generates TLS certificates for `nginx` through the Let's Encrypt service

  While edd is running, you can also get a list of its services by runnning `docker-compose ps`
  from the `docker_services` directory. Each container will be listed in the "Name" column of the
  output, with a name generated by Docker Compose. The name consists of three parts separated
  by underscores:
    * the "project", by default the current directory, may be set using the `-p` flag to
      `docker-compose` or the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable;
    * the "service" name;
    * a counter value, to distinguish multiple containers scaled beyond the first;
  As an example, the container named `edd_worker_1` is the first instance of the `worker`
  service in the `edd` project. You can also use `docker ps` from anywhere on the host to get a
  similar listing, though it will include all containers running on your host, not just those
  defined by EDD.

* __`docker-compose` commands__
    * View logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
    * See more in the [Docker Compose documentation][8]

* __Running multiple copies of EDD__

  If running multiple copies of EDD on one host, you _must_ use the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
  environment variable or add the `-p` flag to every `docker-compose` command. Otherwise, each copy
  will create containers named similar to `dockerservices_edd_1`, because of the name of the
  `docker_services` subdirectory containing the Docker-related files. Commands intended for other
  copies will execute on the first launched copy, and not work as expected.

* __Determining the local URL for EDD's web interfaces:__

  If using a Linux host or Docker for Mac, use the hostname `edd.lvh.me`.
    * __EDD:__ `http://edd.lvh.me/`
    * __EDD's REST API:__ `http://edd.lvh.me/rest/` (if enabled)
    * __EDD's GraphQL API:__ `http://edd.lvh.me/graphql/` (if enabled)
    * __Solr:__ `http://solr.lvh.me/` (if configured in `docker-compose.override.yml`)
    * __Flower:__ `http://flower.lvh.me/` (if configured in `docker-compose.override.yml`)
    * __RabbitMQ Management Plugin:__ `http://rabbitmq.lvh.me/` (if configured in
      `docker-compose.override.yml`)

* __Interfacing with EDD's services from the command line:__
    * Run commands in __existing__ containers with `docker-compose exec $SERVICE $COMMAND`,
      e.g.: `docker-compose exec edd python /code/manage.py shell`
    * Restart misbehaving services with: `docker-compose restart $SERVICE`
