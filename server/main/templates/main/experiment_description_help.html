<h1>What is an Experiment Description file?</h1>

<p>An experiment description file is a simple Excel file that allows you to quickly enter the
    experimental conditions for your Study. EDD needs to know what the experimental
    conditions are for measurements you are importing, preferably before you import the data
    into EDD, and sometimes before even measuring it in the lab. An experiment description
    file is normally the most efficient way to input that information.</p>
<p>Before getting into the details of all the options available in the file, consider
    downloading the sample file. If the sample file makes sense to you out-of-the-box, run
    with it! If this is your first time using EDD, and you are not familiar with the concepts,
    the first thing to do is to learn about Lines.</p>

<div class = "disclose discloseHide">
    <h4><a class="discloseLink" href="#">What are Lines?</a></h4>
    <div class="discloseBody">
        <p>A "Line" in EDD is a distinct set of experimental conditions, e.g. a single
            preparation of culture. A Line generally corresponds to the contents of a shake
            flask or well plate, though it could also be, e.g. a tube containing extract from
            an arabidopsis seed or an enzyme cocktail. We avoided using terms like "sample" to
            prevent confusion with sampling for measurement.</p>
        <p>Each Line has a unique name within the EDD Study, an optional description, and some
            associated metadata that capture the experimental conditions, e.g. growth
            temperature, strain, media, etc. Through an intermediary called an "Assay" that
            you may read about later, a Line captures the association of a set of experimental
            conditions with the resulting measurements. Many casual EDD users wo not need to
            understand the details of what is an Assay.</p>

        <h4>Line naming</h4>
        <p>You will often want the Line names you enter in EDD to be more descriptive than the
            shorthand labels on tiny tubes in the lab. You will likely want to name your Lines
            in EDD for experimental conditions that make them unique so that you and other
            researchers can easily distinguish between them in the user interface or in
            outputs exported from EDD. For example, "WT-LB" (short for "wild type in
            LB media") is more descriptive than the "A1" label on a plate well.</p>
        <p>Your organization will likely encourage you to use a standard Line naming
            convention to help other researchers easily understand your data. See examples
            below for some typical Line names and characteristics.</p>

<h3>Experiment description basics</h3>

<p>An experiment description file is an efficient way for you to add Lines to your Study with
    a minimum of data entry. In the simplest case, each row of the file represents
    experimental conditions for a single Line in your Study. For example, consider the
    following single-row experiment description file:</p>

<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Line Name</th>
            <th>Line Description</th>
            <th>Media</th>
            <th>Part ID</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
            <td>Wildtype s. cervisae</td>
            <td>LB</td>
            <td>JBx_042441</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<div class="caption">Figure 2: Simple experiment description file
    <a href="{% static 'main/example/Figure_2_Simple_Experiment_Description.xlsx' %}">
        <span class="dropLink dropImg">__</span>
    </a>
</div>

<p>Dropping this file into EDD creates a single Line, visible in the Study's "Lines" section
    in nearly identical form to the input file:</p>

<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Strain</th>
            <th>Carbon Source(s)</th>
            <th>Labeling</th>
            <th>Media</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
            <td>BY4742</td>
            <td>--</td>
            <td>--</td>
            <td>LB</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<div class="caption">Figure 3: Resulting Lines table in EDD</div>

<p>The contents of EDD's table are nearly identical to the input file, with some simple
    exceptions. Most notably, "Part ID" is provided as input to help EDD locate the relevant
    strain in ICE, but it is not particularly recognizable to experimentalists. Instead of the
    part ID provided as input to creating the Line, EDD displays the associated strain name
    instead, which should be more useful, while also linking the name to the related
    ICE entry.</p>
<p>You can create multiple Lines, each with replicates, with only a slightly more
    complicated file:</p>

<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Line Name</th>
            <th>Line Description</th>
            <th>Media</th>
            <th>Part ID</th>
            <th>Replicate Count</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
            <td>Wildtype s. cervisae</td>
            <td>LB</td>
            <td>JBx_042441</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>413</td>
            <td>gre3âˆ†;    pMOXYL3 pRS413</td>
            <td>LB</td>
            <td>JBx_039498</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>Each row of the Experiment Description file in Figure 4 is a set of values that define
    distinct experimental conditions, along with replicates of each. Lines created by this
    Experiment Description file would appear in EDD as shown in Figure 5. Note that using the
    replicates column caused the suffix "R-#" to be appended to the Line name from the
    original file to make the resulting Line names unique within the Study.</p>

<h4>Column Options</h4>

<p>Column headers in the Experiment Description file describe characteristics you will assign to
    the Lines, and maybe Assays, in your Study. You can create an Experiment Description file with
    minimal input, but truly capturing the conditions of your experiment for posterity often takes
    a reasonable amount of additional effort. The list of conditions supported by EDD is available
    below, and we suggest that you scan the list and include all the relevant data in your
    Experiment Description file.</p>
<p>Some fixed Line and Assay characteristics are baked into the EDD code and into its Experiment
    Description file format, while others are defined by metadata types that system administrators
    enter into EDD's database.</p>
<p>Chances are good that many experimenters can just run with a subset of the columns from the
    sample file, but see below if you need to add other columns to fully describe the experimental
    conditions in your Study. The goal is to enter enough data into EDD to allow another
    researcher to reproduce your Study with little or no additional context. You should also
    prioritize entering unambiguous / machine-readable metadata in columns rather than describing
    your experiment in text in the "Description" column.</p>

<h5>Primary Line characteristics</h5>

<p>These fundamental Line characteristics are hard-coded into EDD, and will always be available in
    Experiment Description files.</p>
<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Line Characteristic</th>
            <th>Required Column Header</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Interpretation in Experiment Description file</th>
            <th>Required?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Line Name</td>
            <td>A short description that uniquely identifies this set of experimental conditions
                within your Study. Experimenters often include, e.g. the strain number, plate
                number, etc.</td>
            <td>Exact value is used to name the Line, or the prefix for Line names if multiple
                replicates are used or if combinatorial Line creation features are in use
                (see below). This value will also be the prefix for Assays created by the file.
                Values that duplicate existing Lines in the Study or other rows in the file will
                cause the entire file upload to fail.</td>
            <td>YES</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Line Description</td>
            <td>
                <p>A short human-readable description for the Line. Ideally all experimental
                    conditions will be captured as machine-readable metadata, but anything not
                    currently captured as metadata should be inserted here.</p>
                <p>Column header value matches the one generated by ICE's bulk download and used
                    by EDD's bulk Line creation script.</p>
            </td>

        <tr>
            <td>Part ID(s)</td>
            <td>Part ID</td>
            <td>The unique ICE part number identifiers for strains in this culture. Note that
                non-strain ICE entries are not presently allowed in EDD. See below for advanced
                use, and note that this header matches the format of ICE's bulk export and EDD's
                bulk Line creation script.</td>
            <td>Used to link EDD Lines to the referenced ICE strains. See below for directions on

                it. If more than one replicate is created for a Line, the Line name will have the
                suffix "-R#" appended, where # is the replicate number.</td>
            <td>No, but strongly encouraged, especially to save data entry work for EDD
                Line creation</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h5>Optional user-specified metadata</h5>

<p>In addition to the Line characteristics built into EDD, you may also use Experiment Description
    files to provide any Line or Assay metadata defined in EDD's database using the Administration
    tools (with a few exceptions in the initial version--see below). The difference between
    user-specified Line characteristics and built-in characteristics should be transparent to most
    users. In fact, all of the previous examples have used "Media", which is not, strictly
    speaking, one of the built-in Line characteristics described in the table above.</p>
<p>To enter user-defined metadata in your Experiment Description file, just paste the exact text
    of the metadata name as a column header. Again the "Media" column in examples above satisfies
    this criterion.</p>

<div class="disclose discloseHide">
    <a class="discloseLink" href="#">Line Metadata Types</a>
    <div id='lineMetadataTypes' class="discloseBody"></div>
</div>
<div class="disclose discloseHide">
    <a class="discloseLink" href="#">Protocols in this EDD instance</a>
    <div id='protocols' class="discloseBody"></div>
</div>
<div class="disclose discloseHide">
    <a class="discloseLink" href="#">Assay Metadata Types</a>
    <div id='assayMetadataTypes' class="discloseBody"></div>
</div>

<p><b>Unsupported columns</b>: the following Line characteristics are not supported as column
    headers in the initial version of the Experiment Description file: control, carbon source (s),
    Line experimenter, Line contact. You can add these data after creating Lines using EDD's
    <a href="#bulk_editing">bulk Line editing feature.</a></p>

<a name="housekeeping"></a>
<h4>File Format Housekeeping</h4>

<p>You may define columns in any order, as long as the single required column, "Line Name", is
    present. You also do not have to worry about capitalization or accidental use of leading or
    trailing whitespace in the column headers. With the exception of Line names, you can leave any
    non-header cell blank to omit that metadata for Lines or Assays created by the corresponding
    table row. Note that column order in your file <em>can affect naming</em> in the resulting
    Lines or Assays, but only if you use advanced combinatorial features (see below). At the time
    of writing, there's no error checking on non-time inputs, so enter your data carefully!</p>

<a name="advanced"></a>
<h3>Advanced Use</h3>

<a name="bulk"></a>
<h4>Bulk Line Creation</h4>

<p>If your experiment involves use of a large strain library, or many combinations of experimental
    conditions, you may want to consider options for reducing the amount of data entry required to
    create Lines in your EDD Study. See subsections below for several options.</p>

<h5>ICE Bulk Export</h5>

<p>One option is to use ICE's bulk export feature to create a CSV file as a starting point for
    your EDD Experiment Description file. EDD's Experiment Description file purposefully uses
    the same "Part ID" column header as ICE's export, so all you have to do is remove the other
    unnecessary columns from the ICE export, then add other columns to fully describe
    your experiment.</p>

<h5>Combinatorial Line Creation</h5>

<p>If you need to create a large number of Lines to represent your experiment, Experiment
    Description files have advanced options that allow you to significantly cut down on the amount
    of repetitive data entry required. See <a href="#combinatorial_line">Combinatorial Line
    Creation</a> and <a href="#combinatorial_assay">Combinatorial Assay Creation</a> below.</p>

<a name="bulk_editing"></a>
<h5>Bulk Line editing</h5>

<p>An option available to you as a suppliment to Experiment Description files is bulk Line
    editing. After creating Lines in your Study, you can select multiple Lines to edit shared
    characteristics to be applied to all of them simultaneously. From the Experiment Description
    section of a Study that has existing Lines, check the boxes to the left of the Lines you want
    to edit, then hit the edit button to bulk edit them.</p>

<h5>Creating large numbers of Lines</h5>

<p>For Studies with very large numbers of Lines, your browser may time out during upload of an
    Experiment Description file while Lines or Assays are being created, giving the appearance
    that your file upload attempt failed. If this is the case, try refreshing your Study after a
    few minutes to see whether the attempt succeeded. This timeout should not occur often, and
    future improvements may help to avoid it. You can also use the bulk Line creation script to
    avoid this problem (see below).</p>

<h5>Bulk Creation Script</h5>

<p>EDD ships with a command Line based bulk Line creation script that follows a similar format and
    usage pattern to Experiment Description files. This script is largely superceded by the
    Experiment Description file feature, but is also an option for avoiding browser timeouts for
    creation of large numbers of Lines. See documentation for the bulk Line creation script in
    EDD's <a href="https://github.com/JBEI/edd/tree/master/jbei">Github repo</a>.</p>

<a name="combinatorial_line"></a>
<h4>Combinatorial Line Creation</h4>

<p>To reduce the need for repetitive data entry in your Experiment Description file, you can
    append "s" or "(s)" to the end of most column headers, then add comma-separated values in
    that column to have EDD generate Lines combinatorially. Note that when your file contains
    combinatorial input, EDD will insert the values from combinatorial columns into the resulting
    Line names so they are unique (see examples below).</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows an example file that creates Lines combinatorially using different media.</p>
<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Line Name</th>
            <th>Line Description</th>
            <th>Media(s)</th>
            <th>Part ID</th>
            <th>Replicate Count</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
            <td>Wildtype s. cervisae</td>
            <td>LB, EZ, Minimal</td>
            <td>JBx_042441</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<div class="caption">Figure 6: Combinatorial input for media
    <a href="{% static 'main/example/Figure_6_Combinatorial_Media_Values.xlsx' %}">
        <span class="dropLink dropImg">__</span>
    </a>
</div>

<p>The first difference to notice about this file is that "(s)" has been appended to the Line
    metadata column "Media" to inform EDD that values in that column are combinatorial. As a
    result of the altered column label, comma-separated values each result in the creation of a
    new Line, resulting in many fewer rows in the file than Lines it will create in the Study.</p>
<p>Rather than requiring values from the four non-media columns to be entered repetitively for
    each row, inserting media values combinatorially in this example allows each unique value for
    the other columns to be entered into the file once. Figure 7 shows the resulting Lines table
    in EDD. Note that both entries for the "Media(s)" column and replicate numbers have been
    automatically inserted into the Line names to keep them unique.</p>

<p>Figures 6 and 7 show a simplistic combinatorial Line creation, but this feature becomes
    significantly more powerful when you start to use multiple combinatorial columns together in
    the same file.</p>

<h5>Line naming during combinatorial creation</h5>

<p>The relative order of combinatorial metadata columns in your file (those that you appended
    "(s)" to) will dictate the ordering of those metadata values within combinatorially-created
    Line names. Other columns that impact the Line name are the base Line name you've provided in
    the 'Line name' column, and the 'Replicate Count' column, if you used it. The 'Line name' and
    combinatorial values will be included in Line names the order the related columns appear in
    your file. Replicate number will always come last in Line names. For example consider the
    following Experiment Description file, which has columns defined in a different order than the
    previous ones:</p>

<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Line Description</th>
            <th>Media(s)</th>
            <th>Replicate Count</th>
            <th>Line Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Wildtype s. cervisae</td>
            <td>LB, EZ, Minimal</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>Since the "Line Description" column does not include values for combinatorial Line creation
    (has no appended "s" or "(s)"), does not affect Line names. Name-relevant columns are, in
    order: 'Line Name', 'Media(s)'. The order of elements in the resulting Line names will be:</p>

<p>Note that combinatorial Line creation adds another consideration to the process of creating
    your Lines, but unless you are using the combinatorial creation feature, you can define
    columns in your file in any order without affecting the resulting Line names.</p>

<h6>Supported columns for combinatorial creation</h6>

<p>Not all columns are supported for combinatorial Line creation. Columns defined as Line metadata
    (see the "Line Metadata Types" table below) are supported for combinatorial Line creation,
    except for those that are not supported for basic input: control, carbon source (s), Line
    experimenter, Line contact. For primary Line characteristics defined in the table above, only
    the 'Part ID(s)' column may have a comma-delimited list of values entered for combinatorial
    Line creation, though a single entry in the "Replicates" columns will also result in
    combinatorial creation of Lines.</p>

<h5>Special case: strain groups</h5>

<p>EDD also supports combinatorially creating Lines that contain multiple strains. To specify
    multiple strains to be used together as a group, separate part numbers with a semicolon and
    enclose the group with parenthesis. For example, an Experiment Description file with the
    following Part ID(s) column would create two Lines, each one with two strains in co-culture:
    (JBx_123; JBx_456), (JBx_789, JBx_012).</p>

<a name="assay_creation"></a>
<h4>Assay Creation</h4>

<p>In addition to creating Lines as in examples above, you can also use Experiment Description
    files to create Assays associated with the Lines in your Study. Recall that an Assay is the
    application of a specific experimental protocol to a Line (see Figure 1 above). Most users
    will not need to create Assays using Experiment Description files, since EDD's data import
    process creates Assays during the import process. The purpose of creating Assays using
    Experiment Description files is to use EDD to help in configuring instrumentation. For
    supported workflows, EDD has a capability to export a worklist file useful for configuring the
    instruments, and for simplifying the import process for resulting measurement data. When using
    supported instrumentation, it can be significantly less work overall to describe your
    experiment in EDD first before running parts of the experiment.</p>

<div class = "disclose discloseHide">
    <h6><a class="discloseLink" href="#">What is an Assay?</a></h6>
    <div class="discloseBody">
        <p>An "Assay" is the application of a specific protocol (e.g. proteomics) to a Line. In
            the simple case, you can often think of an Assay as the result of loading your sample
            into an instrument. Any of the following lab examples would result in creation of an
            Assay in EDD:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a spectrophotometer to measure optical density of a sample</li>
            <li>Performing proteomics measurements on a sample</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Many Assays will only be performed once during the course of an experiment, and relate
            to a single instant in time. While some Assays are associated with a fixed point in
            time, while others will cover a span of time. For example, automated platforms such as
            the BioHector [sic] may perform Assays on a sample that span a long time period. As
            such, an Assay can contain one or many measurements.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>To create an Assay using your Experiment Description file, you will need to assign at least
    one metadata value to the Assay. To provide Assay metadata in your Experiment Description
    file, add one or more column headers that start with a protocol name and end with the name of
    the Assay metadata you want to insert. For example, a common use case will be to set times for
    proteomics experiments. See <a href="#column_options">Column Options</a> above for a list of
    protocols in this EDD instance. The following example file creates a single Line and one
    associated Assay:</p>

<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Line Name</th>
            <th>Line Description</th>
            <th>Media</th>
            <th>Part ID</th>
            <th>Targeted Proteomics Time</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
            <td>Wildtype s. cervisae</td>
            <td>LB</td>
            <td>JBx_042441</td>
            <td>6h</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<div class="caption">Figure 10: Simple Assay creation
    <a href="{% static 'main/example/Figure_10_Assay_Creation.xlsx' %}">
        <span class="dropLink dropImg">__</span>
    </a>
</div>


<p>The "Targeted Proteomics Time" column is responsible for creating an Assay. Breaking this
    header down into its parts:</p>

<table class="figureTable" id="lineNamePartsTable">
    <tr>
        <td>"Targeted Proteomics":</td>
        <td>the protocol</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>" "</td>
        <td>a space separator</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"Time"</td>
        <td>the name of the Assay metadata</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Dropping this file into EDD creates a single Line, visible in the Study's "Lines" section in
    nearly identical form to the input file:</p>

<table class="figureTable">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Strain</th>
            <th>Carbon Source(s)</th>
            <th>Labeling</th>
            <th>Media</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>WT-Control</td>
            <td>BY4742</td>
            <td>--</td>
            <td>--</td>
            <td>LB</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<div class="caption">Figure 11: Resulting Line</div>

<p>It <em>also</em> makes the Study's "Data" section visible, which indicates that an Assay has
    been created. The single Assay that's created, "181-aceF", has the same name as the associated
    Line. Note that the time entered via the Experiment Description file is not visible, but is
    stored in EDD. The Data table's "Measuring Times" column only displays times for measurements,
    but remains blank since there's no associated data (only time meta-data).</p>

<h5>Special case: Assay times</h5>

<p>To clarify units for time, Assay times must be entered with a trailing "h". For example "12h"
    indicates that an Assay was performed at 12 hours. Precision of your data entry for time
    dictates the number of digits of time inserted into the related Assay names. Assay names
    will be created using number of maximum number of digits after the decimal point of any time
    value in your file.</p>

<a name="combinatorial_assay"></a>
<h4>Combinatorial Assay Creation</h4>

<p>You can also use experiment description files to combinatorially create Assays associated with
    the Lines in your Study. See the <a href="#combinatorial_line">Combinatorial Line
    Creation</a> section above for a detailed summary of how combinatorial creation works. It is
    essentially the same for Lines and Assays: you append an "(s)" to the column header, then
    enter comma-delimited values that each get applied to a single Line or Assay. A notable exception
    is that Assay-related columns in Experiment Description files will start with a protocol name
    and end with Assay metadata. Using the example file from Figure 10 above, you could add "(s)"
    to the last column, then enter values for combinatorial Assay creation.</p>

<h5>Combinatorial Assay naming</h5>

<p>Assays created via Experiment Description files are named identically to the Lines they
    relate to. This allows Assay names to remain unique within each protocol, though Assays may
    have identical names across different protocols.</p>
