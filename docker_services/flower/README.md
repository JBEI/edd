# flower 1.0.1

This Dockerfile builds an image to run the [Celery Flower][1] monitoring tool for [Celery][2]
task queues. It uses the 1.0.1 development version. The image is not meant to be run stand-alone.
The container will wait for the [RabbitMQ][3] service to begin responding before it launches.

Images are tagged with the version of Flower installed. Additional tags include the build date,
for reproducing environments. e.g. jbei/flower:1.0.1 will point to the latest build that uses
Flower v1.0.1, and jbei/flower:1.0.1-20180613 will point to the image built on 13 June, 2018.

* __AMQP_ADMIN_HOST__: the host to use when connecting to RabbitMQ admin (default `rabbitmq`)
