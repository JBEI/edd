# This docker-compose.override.yml file contains local overrides to the Docker Compose
#   configuration of EDD. A copy based on docker-compose.override.yml-example -- containing some
#   example overrides in configuration to use in development environments -- will be created from
#   running the init-config script. Change the values here to alter the settings used when
#   launching with the `docker-compose` commands.

# SECURITY:
# Note that defaults configured in this file MUST keep default EDD installs secure so that clients
#   installing EDD out-of-the-box are not exposing services unintentionally.

# To use the docker-compose.yml file without these overrides, launch Docker Compose like this:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml {COMMAND}

# To use the docker-compose.yml file with different overrides, launch Docker Compose like this:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f different.yml {COMMAND}

# Order matters when specifying overrides! Any scalar values will use the last specified value,
#   while any lists or dictionaries are merged. View the complete configuration used with:
#   docker-compose [[-f file] ...] config

version: '3.6'

networks:
  # Include this network if using the nginx/docker-gen/letsencrypt containers
  proxynet: {}

volumes:

  # Override existing volume definitions by adding an entry with the same name here. If using a
  #   setup with nginx launched with all the other containers, the entries for attachdata and
  #   staticdata will remain empty and have no effect. If using the split nginx configuration,
  #   the entries for both will point to the Docker Volume definitions from the init-config script
  attachdata: {}
  staticdata: {}

  # While the solrdata definition here instructs compose to use the volume named my_volume
  #   in place of the default PROJECTNAME_solrdata volume created by Compose. To use
  #   the my_volume volume, you *must* create it yourself using a command like:
  #   `docker volume create --name my_volume`
  #solrdata:
  #  external:
  #    name: my_volume

  # The tlsdata definition here is used by the nginx and letsencrypt services later in file
  nginx_certs: {}
  nginx_confd: {}
  nginx_vhost: {}
  nginx_webroot: {}

  # Add new volume definition(s) by creating new name(s).
  #mycustomdata: {}

services:

  # Uncomment a service block to override the settings for that block. Examples below override
  #   settings to expose service ports to all addresses of the Docker host.
  #postgres:
  #  # Make the postgres 5432 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '5432:5432'
  #redis:
  #  # Make the redis 6379 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '6379:6379'
  #solr:
  #  # Make the solr 8983 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '8983:8983'
  #rabbitmq:
  #  # Make the rabbitmq management 15672 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '15672:15672'
  #flower:
  #  # Make the flower 5555 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '5555:5555'

  # Override settings for EDD container(s).
  edd:

    # Override image name to reference something other than jbei/edd-core:latest
    #image: tagname

    # Examples of overriding the default initialize command below.
    # To initialize EDD without attempting to run database migrations:
    #command: [-M, application]
    # To initialize EDD without attempting to load a database or re-index:
    #command: [-DI, application]
    # To initialize EDD but wait for a newly-defined service foobar to listen on port 1234:
    #command: [--wait-host, foobar, --wait-port, 1234, application]
    # To run all setup tasks, but not launch the EDD application:
    #command: [init-only]
    # [DEVMODE] By default, edd runs with the application command; uncomment below to run with
    #   the devmode command instead, and use Django's runserver to serve the application.
    # command: [--watch-static, devmode]
    # [LOCAL] For more control over settings on each container, use the --local flag to pass a
    #   path to a local.py file to use. The path must be mounted in the volumes section! Take care
    #   to use only one volumes section, if multiples are specified in a service, only the last
    #   specified is used.
    #command: [--local, /etc/myorg/edd/local.py, -w, edd, application]
    #volumes:
    #  - /full/path/to/local.py:/etc/myorg/edd/local.py

  # The section below, until the comment reading "END LET'S ENCRYPT CONFIGS" contains a set of

  #   of EDD. We recommend production deployments to replace this with the webserver/proxy used
